I'm jds691 || he/him ||, just a teen who's still learning to code. I'm currently learning C# and C++ for desktop application development as well as Python for fun

## Languages

### C#

Currently I'm just familiar with windows forms and I'm learning WPF in hopes of creating my own C#/C++ application.

### C++

Don't currently know much C++ but I'm willing to learn and look through code I can find here.

### Python

I don't have any projects or uses for Python. However, the language interests me and that's good enough for me.
